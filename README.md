# Machine Learning Specialization Projects

This repository contains projects completed during the three courses of the **Machine Learning Specialization** offered by **_DeepLearning.ai_** and **_Stanford Online_**.

## Courses:
1. **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms**
3. **Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**

Each course includes mandatory labs conducted on Colab through Coursera, which are not included in this repository. Instead, this repository contains projects created in parallel, applying the knowledge gained from these courses. While the projects may not directly align with the course themes, they demonstrate the skills learned.

To explore the projects, navigate to the relevant folders and open the files to view the Colab execution flow.
